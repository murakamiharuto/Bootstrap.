# Getting started

### Dependencies

ng2-bootstrap contains all core (and not only) Bootstrap components powered by Angular 2. So you don't need to include original JS components, but we are using markup and css provided by Bootstrap.
    
Additionally to allow reach experience while working with Dates we are using [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), de facto base date manipulation library at the moment.

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save ng2-bootstrap
```

### Reading documentation

Each `ng2-bootstrap` component has api and annotation docs, examples and working demo. Each `property` and `event` has type annotation and default value if any.
